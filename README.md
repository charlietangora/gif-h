gif-h
=====

This one-header library offers a simple, very limited way to create animated GIFs directly in code.
Those looking for particular cleverness are likely to be disappointed; it's pretty much a straight-ahead
implementation of the GIF format with optional Floyd-Steinberg dithering. (It does at least use delta
encoding - only the changed portions of each frame are saved.) 

So resulting files are often quite large. The hope is that it will be handy nonetheless as a quick and easily-integrated way for programs to spit out animations.

There are two supported input formats, RGBA8 (the alpha is ignored), and 8-bit paletted (with a
power-of-two palette size).  (In the latter case you can save up to 768 bytes per frame by providing
a global palette and reusing it for some frames.)  You can freely mix 32-bit and 8-bit input frames,
and even frames with differing sizes. Note that only 8-bit input frames can have transparent areas
(producing a transparent GIF disables delta-coding).

Usage:
-------------------
Create a GifWriter struct. 

Pass the struct to GifBegin() to initialize values and write the file header.

Pass frames of the animation to GifWriteFrame() or GifWriteFrame8().

Finally, call GifEnd() to close the file handle and free memory.
